It's essential to act swiftly and efficiently to ensure the patient's safety and stabilize their condition. Here's what you should do:\n\n1. **Ensure Immediate Safety**: First, make sure the area is safe for both you and the other staff members. If there is any danger, contact security or law enforcement for assistance.\n\n2. **Call for Help**: Activate the emergency response system within your hospital or clinic. Notify the emergency department and ensure that the trauma team is ready to receive and assess the patient as soon as possible.\n\n3. **Initial Assessment**: If you're trained to do so, perform basic first aid to control bleeding until the trauma team arrives. Applying direct pressure to the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth can help manage bleeding.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Document any information you can obtain about the injury's circumstances and history, which will be valuable to the medical team and law enforcement.\n\n5. **Communication and Coordination**: Communicate clearly with your team about the patient's status and ensure seamless coordination with emergency services and specialists, such as surgeons or radiologists who may need to be involved.\n\nYour prompt and organized response will significantly contribute to the patient's care and recovery. If there�s anything else you need, please let me know."}]
